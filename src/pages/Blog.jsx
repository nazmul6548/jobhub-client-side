  What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should
we store them on the client side?

  </div>
  <div className="collapse-content"> 
    <p className="font-lato ">Access tokens and refresh tokens are components of the OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol, commonly used in modern web applications to authorize access to resources on behalf of a user without sharing their credentials.</p>
    <p className="font-lato mt-5"><span className="font-lato font-bold">Access Token:</span><br />

An access token is a credential used by a client to access protected resources on an API server.
It is usually a string that represents the authorization granted to the client and is issued by the authorization server after successful authentication and authorization.</p>
    <p className="font-lato mt-5"><span className="font-lato font-bold">Refresh Token:</span><br />

    A refresh token is a special token used to obtain a new access token after the current access token expires.
Refresh tokens are long-lived compared to access tokens and are used to maintain authentication sessions.</p>
